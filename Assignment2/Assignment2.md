#Purpose:
We are going to further practice our requirement breakdown skills in this assignment to
include some user requirements and system based requirements.

#Scenario:
Your client is an AI developer who uses publicly available data to train their AI. They have
approached you to help them over come some of their difficulties.
The client uses a technique called web scraping to generate their training data.
You have had a few meetings with the client. At this point, you are quite confident that you
understand the challenge.
You’ve narrowed it down to the following:
- Developers want to have categorized training questions that are separate from the
answers because developers care about self-affirmation.
- Developers want to know that the training data they are using is “balanced” (does
not contain biases) because this will give them better AI models.
